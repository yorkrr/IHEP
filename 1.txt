I changed something.
I changed it twice
I changed it third.

Unbelievable! It still contain the initail state!
Now I fix a problem from the branch:fotfix.

Now I vimmed it on Second_Branch.
But I forgot to commit.
Now I finished the final work and want to merge it with the branch:main,but it has been changed by branch:hotfix. So this branch is still point to main which is n not changed by hotfix?maybe it can be automaticly check.
In fact, there is a conflict as I both modified the 1.txt.
Now I conserve all.
